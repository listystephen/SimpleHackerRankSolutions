Problem 
-------
Brie’s Drawing teacher asks her class to open their n-page book to page number p . Brie can either start turning pages
 from the front of the book (i.e., page number 1 ) or from the back of the book (i.e., page number n ), and she always
 turns pages one-by-one (as opposed to skipping through multiple pages at once). When she opens the book, page 1 is always
 on the right side:



Each page in the book has two sides, front and back, except for the last page which may only have a front side depending on the total number of pages of the book (see the Explanation sections below for additional diagrams).

Given  and , find and print the minimum number of pages Brie must turn in order to arrive at page p .

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, n , denoting the number of pages in the book. 
The second line contains an integer, p, denoting the page that Brie's teacher wants her to turn to.









#!/bin/python

import sys

def solve(n, p):
    return min(p/2, n/2 - p/2)
    # Complete this function

n = int(raw_input().strip())
p = int(raw_input().strip())
result = solve(n, p)
print(result)
