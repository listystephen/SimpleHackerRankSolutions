Beautiful Days at the Movies
---------------------------------

Problem
--------

Lily likes to play games with integers and their reversals. For some integer x, we define reverse(x) to be the reversal of all 
digits in x. For example, reversed(123) 321,reversed(21)=12 , and reversed(120)=21.

Logan wants to go to the movies with Lily on some day x satisfying i<=x<=j, but he knows she only goes to the movies on days
 she considers to be beautiful. Lily considers a day to be beautiful if the absolute value of the difference between  x
and  reversed(x) is evenly divisible by k.

Given i, j, and k, count and print the number of beautiful days when Logan and Lily can go to the movies.

Input Format

A single line of three space-separated integers describing the respective values of i, j, and k.

        while(temp > 0):
            rem = temp%10 
            rev = rev * 10 + rem
            temp = temp//10
#        print rev
        if abs(n - rev)%k == 0:
            count+=1
    return count
