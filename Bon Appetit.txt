Problem
-------- 
Anna and Brian order n items at a restaurant, but Anna declines to eat any of the k th item (where 0<=k<n ) due to an allergy. 
When the check comes, they decide to split the cost of all the items they shared;
however, Brian may have forgotten that they didn't split the k th item and accidentally charged Anna for it.

You are given , , the cost of each of the  items, and the total amount of money that Brian charged Anna for her portion 
of the bill. If the bill is fairly split, print " Bon Appetit"; otherwise, 
print the amount of money that Brian must refund to Anna. It is guaranteed that the amount will always be an integer.

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of n (the number of items ordered) 
and  (the -based index of the item that Anna did not eat). 
The second line contains  space-separated integers where each integer i  denotes the cost, c[i] , of item i 
(where 0<= i <n)). 
The third line contains an integer,b (charged) , denoting the amount of money that Brian charged Anna for her share of the bill.
