Utopian Tree
-------------

Problem
--------

The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. Each spring, it doubles in height. Each summer, its height 
increases by 1 meter.

Laura plants a Utopian Tree sapling with a height of 1 meter at the onset of spring. How tall will her tree be after N
growth cycles?

Input Format
------------

The first line contains an integer, T , the number of test cases. 
T subsequent lines each contain an integer, N , denoting the number of cycles for that test case.
