Jumping on the Clouds
----------------------

Emma is playing a new mobile game involving n clouds numbered from 0 to n-1. A player initially starts out on cloud c0, 
and they must jump to cloud cn-1. In each step, she can jump from any cloud i to cloud i+1 or cloud i+2.

There are two types of clouds, ordinary clouds and thunderclouds. The game ends if Emma jumps onto a thundercloud, 
but if she reaches the last cloud (i.e.,cn-1 ), she wins the game!



Can you find the minimum number of jumps Emma must make to win the game? It is guaranteed that clouds c0 and cn-1 are 
ordinary-clouds and it is always possible to win the game.
