Problem
-------

John works at a clothing store and he's going through a pile of socks to find the number of matching pairs.
 More specifically, he has a pile of n loose socks i where each sock  is labeled with an integer ci, , denoting its color.
 He wants to sell as many socks as possible, but his customers will only buy them in matching pairs. Two socks, i and j, 
are a single matching pair if they have the same color (ci=cj).

Given  and the color of each sock, how many pairs of socks can John sell?

Input Format :

The first line contains an integer n , denoting the number of socks. 
The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the respective values of c0,c1,c2...cn-1.

import sys
import collections

def sockMerchant(n, ar):
    count = []
    counter = collections.Counter(ar)
#   print counter
    for k,v in counter.iteritems():
        count.append(v/2)
    return sum(count)
    


n = int(raw_input().strip())
ar = map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' '))
result = sockMerchant(n, ar)
print(result)
