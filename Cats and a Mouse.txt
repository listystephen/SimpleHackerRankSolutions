Problem
------------

Two cats named A and B are standing at integral points on the x-axis. Cat A is standing at point x and cat B is standing
at point y . Both cats run at the same speed, and they want to catch a mouse named C that's hiding at integral point z on
the x-axis. Can you determine who will catch the mouse?

You are given q queries in the form of x , y, and z. For each query, print the appropriate answer on a new line:

If cat A catches the mouse first, print Cat A.
If cat B catches the mouse first, print Cat B.
If both cats reach the mouse at the same time, print Mouse C as the two cats fight and mouse escapes.

import sys

def catAndMouse(x, y, z):
    if abs(x-z) < abs(y-z):
        return 'Cat A'
    elif abs(x-z) == abs(y-z):
        return "Mouse C"
    else:
        return "Cat B"
    # Complete this function

if __name__ == "__main__":
    q = int(raw_input().strip())
    for a0 in xrange(q):
        x, y, z = raw_input().strip().split(' ')
        x, y, z = [int(x), int(y), int(z)]
        result = catAndMouse(x, y, z)
        print "".join(map(str, result))
