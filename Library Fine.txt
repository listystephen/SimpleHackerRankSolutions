Library Fine
--------------


Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that 
calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:

If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.: fine=0 .
If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected 
return date, fine = 15 x no.of days late .
If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return 
date, the fine = 500 x no.of months late .
If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of 10000 .



Input Format

The first line contains  space-separated integers denoting the respective , , and  on which the book was actually 
returned. 
The second line contains  space-separated integers denoting the respective , , and  on which the book was expected to 
be returned (due date).
