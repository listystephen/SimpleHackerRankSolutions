Problem
--------

Maria plays n games of college basketball in a season. Because she wants to go pro, she tracks her points scored per 
game sequentially in an array defined as score = [s0,s1......sn-1] . After each game i , she checks to see if score  breaks her record for most 
or least points scored so far during that season.
Given Maria's array of scores  for a season of n games, find and print the number of times she breaks her record for most
and least points scored during the season.

Note: Assume her records for most and least points at the start of the season are the number of points scored during the first game of the season.
