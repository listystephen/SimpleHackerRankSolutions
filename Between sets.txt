Problem

Consider two sets of positive integers A= {a0,a1 ....an-1},  and B= {b0,b1 ....bn-1}. We say that a positive integer x, , is between sets A and B  if the following conditions are satisfied:

1. All elements in A are factors of x .
2. x is a factor of all elements in B.

In other words, some x is between A and B if that value of  x satisfies x mod ai for every ai in A and also satisfies bi mod xi = 0 for every bi in B. For example A= {2,6}, if  and B= {12}, 
then our possible  values are 6 and 12.

Given A and B, find and print the number of integers (i.e., possible xs) that are between the two sets.
