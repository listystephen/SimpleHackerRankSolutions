Problem
-------

When you select a contiguous block of text in a PDF viewer, the selection is highlighted with a blue rectangle. 
In a new kind of PDF viewer, the selection of each word is independent of the other words; this means that each 
rectangular selection area forms independently around each highlighted word. For example:

PDF-highighting.png

In this type of PDF viewer, the width of the rectangular selection area is equal to the number of letters in the word 
times the width of a letter, and the height is the maximum height of any letter in the word.

Consider a word consisting of lowercase English alphabetic letters, where each letter is  wide. Given the height of 
each letter in millimeters (mm), find the total area that will be highlighted by blue rectangle in mm^2 when the given word 
is selected in our new PDF viewer.

Input Format

The first line contains 26 space-separated integers describing the respective heights of each consecutive lowercase 
English letter (i.e., ha,hb,.....hy,hz). 
The second line contains a single word, consisting of lowercase English alphabetic letters.
