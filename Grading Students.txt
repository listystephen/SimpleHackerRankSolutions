Problem 
--------

Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:

If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3 , round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
If the value of  is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.








#!/bin/python

import sys

def solve(grades):
    for i in range(len(grades)):
        if (grades[i])>=38:
            if (grades[i]%10 == 3) or (grades[i]%10 ==8):
                grades[i] += 2
            elif (grades[i]%10 == 4) or (grades[i]%10 == 9):
                grades[i] += 1
            
    return grades
    # Complete this function

n = int(raw_input().strip())
grades = []
grades_i = 0
for grades_i in xrange(n):
    grades_t = int(raw_input().strip())
    grades.append(grades_t)
result = solve(grades)

print "\n".join(map(str, result))
