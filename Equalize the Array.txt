Equalize the Array
---------------------
Problem
-------

Karl has an array of n integers defined as A = a0,a1....an-1 . In one operation, he can delete any element from the array.

Karl wants all the elements of the array to be equal to one another. To do this, he must delete zero or more elements 
from the array. Find and print the minimum number of deletion operations Karl must perform so that all the array's 
elements are equal(same elements in array)




#!/bin/python

import sys
import collections

def equalizeArray(arr):
    counter = collections.Counter(arr)
    
    if max(counter)==1:
        return len(arr)-1
    else:
        return len(arr) - max(counter.values())    


if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(raw_input().strip())
    arr = map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' '))
    result = equalizeArray(arr)
    print result
